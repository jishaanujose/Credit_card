# Credit card default payment prediction

# Problem Statement
People's failure to pay their credit card payments could be caused by a variety of factors.
It is, nevertheless, considered a fraud when it is done on purpose, that is, when customers have no intention of repaying the bank.
In any case, credit card firms are exposed to a significant risk, and there is a need to find a mechanism to alert them. 

# Solution 
A machine learning approach is proposed here to address this issue, which can anticipate future default accounts based on certain features.

 This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. 

The dataset used in the project is taken from:
